## 1. Summary
This BEP describes a proposal to improve sidechain staking reward distribution on Binance Chain.

## 2. Abstract
Instead of distributing sidechain staking rewards in a single block for each day, this proposal suggests distributing staking rewards in many consecutive blocks, to avoid heavy burdens on any specific blocks.

## 3. Status
This BEP is a draft.

## 4. Motivation
Currently, sidechain's staking rewards are distributed in the first block of a day on Binance Chain (we can call the block as breath block). With the increasing number of delegators (more than 50,000 nowdays), it will lead to a heavy load to breath blocks, and users' transactions/requests could be affacted. Meanwhile, it could be also a bottleneck for furthur evalution of Binance Chain. Thus, this proposal provides a solution to fix the issue and benefit the evaluation of Binance Chain as well hopefully.

## 5. Specification
### 5.1 Overall Workflow
![overall workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61674316/148506577-aac9d05a-488d-4ff0-b879-1aa1a0e5364c.png)

The overall distribution processes work like this:
 - in breath blocks, validators' commission fees will be distributed, delegators' rewards will be saved to a separated store
 - after a breath block, delegators' rewards in batches any consecutive blocks 

### 5.2 Distribution Batch Size

Distribution batch size controls how many delegator's rewards will be distributed in a block. It should be evaluated and ajusted to make sure:
 - a day's staking rewards should be not distributed in many days, which also means the batch size should not be too small
 - should not be too big, which could cause heavy load on a single block

At the same time, this batch size can also be governed by submitting sidechain proposal.

### 5.3 User Impact

The impact to general users (i.e., delegators) is that their rewards will be delayed a bit after applying this proposal. However, the delay is very samll and can be ingored when comparing to the whole delegation process. Taking current delegation volume as an example, if 50,000 delegators' rewards are distributed, with batch size equals to 100, then at the worst case the delay is 3~4 minutes (500 blocks).
